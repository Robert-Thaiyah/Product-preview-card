## Overview
This challenge really knocked home how I have forgoten the basics of HTML divs and happy that I was able to find the solution easily.
As a small punishment, I will be practising more on how to arrange html tags till I get it right. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
